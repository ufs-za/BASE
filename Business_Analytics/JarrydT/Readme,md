# Purchase Intention Prediction App

This application predicts a customerâ€™s intent to purchase based on several different factors, including customer experience ratings and demographic information. The prediction is conducted using a pre-trained **Random Forest** model, which generates predictions based on user inputs. 

## How It Works

Users are asked to provide their inputs such as their customer type and experience ratings. After submitting the inputs by clicking the **Predict Purchase Intention** button, the app displays the predicted **Purchase Intention Level** on a scale from 1 to 5, where:
- **1** indicates very low purchase intention
- **5** indicates very high purchase intention

The app provides the final prediction of the customers intent to purchase as well as a confidence score, reflecting the model's confidence in the prediction. Furthermore, the app allows for multiple predictions by adjusting inputs and resubmitting and allows users to submit feedback on the prediction and overall experience.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Input Form:** Users can enter values through sliders and radio buttons.
- **Prediction Generation:** The app calculates and displays the Purchase Intention level with a confidence percentage.
- **Feedback Portal:** Users are able to provide feedback on the predictions directly through the app.

## Development Challenges

- **Alignment Issues:** Streamlit's slider and radio buttons have different default font sizes, causing misalignment in the layout. To address this, sliders were placed in a separate section to maintain a neat appearance and to better readability.
  
- **Deployment:** Deploying the app on Streamlit proved to be a challenge due to permission issues and different package versions. To circumvent these issues, permission had to be granted and packages needed to be downgraded or different packages had to be used to obtain the desired outcome.

- **Model Integration:** Loading the **Random Forest** model from a pickle file proved to be difficult  due to compatibility issues with the `pickle` package. This was resolved by using **pandas** to load the pickle file, ensuring that the **Random Forest** model was able to be used.
