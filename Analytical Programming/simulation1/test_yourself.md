## Next steps
This simulation provides an **interactive and visual representation** of how a disease spreads in a scale-free network. The combination of **agent-based modeling, probability-based infection, and real-time visualization** makes it a useful tool for understanding epidemiological patterns in complex networks.

However, the model is insensitive. Your task is:
- to rename the use case from disease spread to a different use case. The new use case should be one of the following ideas:
  a. Investment and Portfolio Risk Analysis
  - Nodes: Different assets in an investment portfolio.
  - Edges: Correlations between asset performance.
  - Infection Mechanism: A market downturn in one sector impacts correlated assets.
  - Application: Model portfolio diversification strategies to mitigate risk contagion.
 b. Market Influence and Brand Reputation Management
- Nodes: Customers, social media influencers, online reviewers.
- Edges: Connections via online interactions, reviews, word-of-mouth.
- Infection Mechanism: A negative review or crisis spreads through the network, damaging brand reputation.
- Application: Monitor influence propagation and intervene before reputation damage escalates.
c. Adoption of Financial Products
- Nodes: Customers in a bank or fintech ecosystem.
- Edges: Social connections, referrals, influence networks.
- Infection Mechanism: A customer adopting a financial product (credit card, loan, investment) influences peers.
- Application: Identify key influencers to drive product adoption and marketing strategies.
d. Employee Turnover & Talent Retention
- Nodes: Employees in an organization.
- Edges: Workplace relationships, teams, mentorship structures.
- Infection Mechanism: Employee dissatisfaction spreads through teams, leading to resignations.
- Application: Identify key influencers and prevent mass attrition.
e. Insider Trading Risk Propagation
- Nodes: Traders, brokers, corporate executives.
- Edges: Business relationships, trading networks.
- Spread Mechanism: Unauthorized financial information leaks and influences trading behaviors.
- Application: Detect how insider information propagates through a network before it impacts markets.
f. Product Recall & Supply Chain Risk Modeling
- Nodes: Suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers.
- Edges: Business and product dependency relationships.
- Spread Mechanism: A product defect spreads through the supply chain, leading to cascading recalls.
- Application: Predict recall impacts and develop early intervention strategies.
g. Employee Productivity and Performance Influence
- Nodes: Employees in an organization.
- Edges: Influence relationships (mentorship, team collaboration).
- Spread Mechanism: High-performing employees influence peers, but disengagement or toxic work culture can also spread.
- Application: Improve employee retention and performance by identifying positive and negative network influences.
