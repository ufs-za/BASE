## Next steps
This simulation provides an **interactive and visual representation** of how a disease spreads in a scale-free network. The combination of **agent-based modeling, probability-based infection, and real-time visualization** makes it a useful tool for understanding epidemiological patterns in complex networks.

However, the model is insensitive. Your task is:
- To rename the use case from disease spread to a different use case. The new use case should be one of the ideas below
- Rename the variables in the code to fit the use case. In other words, remove the word "dead" and replace it with something that is relevant to the use case and sensitive to the context.

**a. Investment and Portfolio Risk Analysis**
- Nodes: Different assets in an investment portfolio.
- Edges: Correlations between asset performance.
- Infection Mechanism: A market downturn in one sector impacts correlated assets.
- Application: Model portfolio diversification strategies to mitigate risk contagion.
  
**b. Market Influence and Brand Reputation Management**
  - Nodes: Customers, social media influencers, online reviewers.
  - Edges: Connections via online interactions, reviews, word-of-mouth.
  - Infection Mechanism: A negative review or crisis spreads through the network, damaging brand reputation.
  - Application: Monitor influence propagation and intervene before reputation damage escalates.
    
**c. Adoption of Financial Products**
  - Nodes: Customers in a bank or fintech ecosystem.
  - Edges: Social connections, referrals, influence networks.
  - Infection Mechanism: A customer adopting a financial product (credit card, loan, investment) influences peers.
  - Application: Identify key influencers to drive product adoption and marketing strategies.
    
**d. Employee Turnover & Talent Retention**
  - Nodes: Employees in an organization.
  - Edges: Workplace relationships, teams, mentorship structures.
  - Infection Mechanism: Employee dissatisfaction spreads through teams, leading to resignations.
  - Application: Identify key influencers and prevent mass attrition.
    
**e. Insider Trading Risk Propagation**
  - Nodes: Traders, brokers, corporate executives.
  - Edges: Business relationships, trading networks.
  - Spread Mechanism: Unauthorized financial information leaks and influences trading behaviors.
  - Application: Detect how insider information propagates through a network before it impacts markets.
    
**f. Product Recall & Supply Chain Risk Modeling**
  - Nodes: Suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers.
  - Edges: Business and product dependency relationships.
  - Spread Mechanism: A product defect spreads through the supply chain, leading to cascading recalls.
  - Application: Predict recall impacts and develop early intervention strategies.
    
**g. Employee Productivity and Performance Influence**
  - Nodes: Employees in an organization.
  - Edges: Influence relationships (mentorship, team collaboration).
  - Spread Mechanism: High-performing employees influence peers, but disengagement or toxic work culture can also spread.
  - Application: Improve employee retention and performance by identifying positive and negative network influences.

Remember, that this simple model can be extended to incorporate:
- **Implimentation strategies** (nodes gaining some property after the change)
- **Different probabilities** based on node importance
- **Spread limitation measures** to limit spread

Future improvements could include **more advanced recovery rules, social distancing effects, and agent movement behaviors** for even more realistic simulations.
