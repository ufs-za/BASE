# Business Analytics, Statistics, and Econometrics (BASE)

## Welcome to the Econometrics Sub-Group
In the dynamic world of data, the Business Analytics, Statistics, and Econometrics (BASE) group stands as a beacon of innovation and expertise. We are a leading research group at the Faculty of Economics and Management Sciences, dedicated to harnessing the power of analytics to drive decision-making processes and solve business problems.

### Overview
Our focus is on applying analytics expertise to social media, economic indicators, and business insights. We employ deep dive analytics, agent-based modelling, and AI solutions through an interdisciplinary, output-driven, evidence-based approach. Our work adds visibility to the research expertise in this domain.

### Methodologies and value proposition
Our approach to business analytics involves several key techniques:

Econometrics is a branch of economics that applies statistical methods to the empirical study of economic relationships. It involves the measurement and analysis of economic phenomena and has a significant role in economic forecasting, policy analysis, and decision-making. Key indicators used in econometrics include GDP (Gross Domestic Product), inflation rates, unemployment rates, and interest rates. These indicators help economists understand the health of an economy and predict future trends. Additionally, econometricians often use regression models to explore the relationships between different economic variables. For instance, they might use a regression model to understand how changes in interest rates affect GDP. Overall, econometrics provides valuable tools for understanding and interpreting complex economic data.
