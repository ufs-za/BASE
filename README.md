## Welcome to the BASE Group
In the dynamic world of data, the Business Analytics, Statistics, and Econometrics (BASE) group stands as a beacon of innovation and expertise. We are a leading research group at the Faculty of Economics and Management Sciences, dedicated to harnessing the power of analytics to drive decision-making processes and solve business problems.

### Overview
Our focus is on applying analytics expertise to social media, economic indicators, and business insights. To do so there is a file for each focus group, including **GAI**. **GAI** stands for Generative Artificial Intelligence, which is an important addition to the BASE arsenal that sped up the rate of innovation within this domain. Within the BASE group, we actively use GAI to advance the understanding and science within the field. We employ deep dive analytics, agent-based modelling, and AI solutions through an interdisciplinary, output-driven, evidence-based approach. Our work adds visibility to the research expertise in this domain.

### Methodologies
Our methodologies are rooted in the application of advanced analytics. We leverage techniques such as machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition, data mining for knowledge discovery, predictive modeling for forecasting, and statistical analysis for hypothesis testing. These methodologies allow us to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, enabling us to provide actionable recommendations and strategies. Furthermore, we action insights by aggregating composite indicators for economic insight.

### Expertise
The BASE group is led by Dr Herkulaas MvE Combrink and comprises a variety of students and staff from the UFS. Our shared vision is “Data Science for Output Driven and Evidence Based Impact”. This growing team of highly skilled students and researchers have diverse backgrounds in business analytics, statistics, econometrics, and computer science. Our expertise lies in our ability to apply these techniques to real-world problems.

### Value Proposition
The BASE group offers a unique value proposition through its interdisciplinary approach to research and problem-solving. We share our findings and research on an institutional GitHub Platform, through academic publications, and through engaged scholarship. Our work not only contributes to the academic field but also provides practical solutions to businesses and policymakers across various sectors. By supporting our research, you are investing in the development of innovative solutions that have the potential to transform industries and drive economic growth.

### Envisaged Outputs for 2024/2025
- Creation of a short learning programme in regional innovation.
- Creation of an Interdisciplinary master’s degree with a focus Business Analytics, Statistics, and Econometrics (BASE).
- 4 x Research outputs (Journal articles) related to Social Stress Index for social media
- 4 x Research outputs (Journal articles) related to analytics and machine learning applications.
- 1 book on regional innovation

The envisaged outputs are possible with financial support to onboard two post-doctoral research fellows and a dedicated PhD student in any of these disciplines to assist in growing the BASE group and field.

### Conclusion
Your support will play a crucial role in advancing our research and contributing to the field of Business Analytics, Statistics, and Econometrics. Together, we can push the boundaries of knowledge, drive innovation, and create a future where data-driven decisions lead to a better world.
