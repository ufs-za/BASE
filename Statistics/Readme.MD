### Methodologies and value proposition
Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, interpretation, analysis, and organization of data. It includes concepts such as descriptive statistics, which summarize data through measures of central tendency and dispersion, and inferential statistics, which make predictions about a population based on a sample. Probability theory, which studies uncertainty, is a fundamental aspect of statistics. Regression analysis is used to understand relationships between variables, and statistical significance helps determine if study findings are likely to be true for a larger population. Overall, statistics is a powerful tool for understanding variability and uncertainty, making informed decisions, and extracting insights from data.
